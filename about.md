## A bit about me

I'm a student learning Russian (among other things). I've been tutoring Russian at my university for several years, and love sharing the language with others. Second language acquisition and teaching (especially with English and Russian) are two of my main interests at the moment. Articulatory and acoustic phonetics come in at close second, and I often have a spectrogram running on my iPad or phone to analyze speech around me.

If you're interested in chatting about language learning or Russian and its grammar, drop me a line :)
