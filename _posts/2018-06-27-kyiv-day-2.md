After eating some food at home, I went out without any particular plans, besides wanting to visit my school and buy some things (razors, food).

![Outside the school](ilc.jpeg)
The school is about 13 minutes walk north of my apartment. It’s on the 6th floor, which reminds me: I’m not sure if people even need gyms here; people walk everywhere and climb lots of stairs. I went in and talked with their admin assistant. I still get nervous actually using my Russian. Like I’m an imposter and they’re going to find out I’m not legit. Silly, but true.

I walked further north looking for a park I’d seen in Google Maps. Missed it and took a second to make plans: I wanted to go see Zoloti Vorota (Golden Gates), a reconstruction of a 12th century building.
But the tram, when it came, was packed. So on a whim I hopped on a bus when it pulled up. No air conditioning, lots of people = hot! It’s in the 70s and 80s here. I’ve been keenly observing how locals behave, doing my best to fit in. They give up their seats for women, children, and the elderly. The elderly expect it, too.

Rode the bus for about 40 minutes until I saw the shopping center Aprel’ (April). Completed today’s mission: get what I need to make potato soup. No celery, though!

Cashiers. Customer service... not friendly! The norm is to not even say hi, much less make conversation. My least favorite thing about Ukraine and Russia. Another example: I called the US Embassy today with a question, and the girl on the phone answered my question and then hung up before I could say anything. Don’t get me wrong, the people are wonderful when you get to know them. Being friendly in public, however, just isn’t a thing.

![A tram like the one I rode](tram.jpeg)
I took a tramvai (tram) home. A ticket is 4 hryvnia - 15 cents. It had air conditioning, and in general was more modern. Almost didn’t get off at my stop because they announced the station in Ukrainian and I didn’t recognize it at first. Compared to driving everywhere, I like the freedom of public transport. Saw lots of the city while riding the bus and tram today.

Walked 15 minutes from the station to my apartment and made potato soup (my mom’s recipe: totally vegan and filling!). So nice to have homemade soup thousands of kilometers from home! Thanks, Mom - you’re the best!

_Plans for tomorrow_
- I may try to meet up with an expat here, a fellow American.
- There’s also a language exchange + dance in the evening, which I’m thinking will be a good place to meet people.

_Pray that:_
- God will use me to my fullest here.
- For strength and protection from spiritual attacks. I feel like I’ve entered a battleground. Praise God, for I have victory in him!
- For my upcoming English teaching course.
- I can get plugged into a local church.

Would love to hear comments, feedback... standard disclaimer that if I’d had more time, I’d have written a shorter letter. I’m interested to know if this is too much detail or too little; I can go either way :)
