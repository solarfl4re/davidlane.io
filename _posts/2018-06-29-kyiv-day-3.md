Started off the day by ordering water and paying for the apartment (for 2 weeks). Funny how you don’t realize what you have until it’s gone; at home in Alaska, we have great water. Here, you don’t drink tap water. I’d got a 6L jug from a nearby store, but it tasted pretty bad. Better than tap water, but barely. So Thursday morning I ordered two 18.9L jugs of water and a pump from ‘Vasha Voda’ (lit. Your water). Success! It tastes so much better. Really, this made my day.

*Almost 19L of water. It’s... more fun to pump water from it than I’m prepared to admit.*

Also paid for the apartment; walked a few minutes north, past all the street vendors and shops to a bankomat (ATM). I withdrew 5,500 hryvnia - $209.

Me and the American (Nicholas) decided to meet for lunch at his favorite place - Gogi. It’s Georgian food, which Nicholas equated to what is Mexican food to the US. I know why it’s his favorite place - great service and food, good prices, and a beautiful location. We sat at the bar. Was fun to see all the fancy drinks being made.

I had a hot, somewhat spicy traditional soup. It had peppers, eggplant, potatoes and more. I’ve never had a soup like it. Nicholas got some sort of bean dip with bread, salad, and a plate of salmon. There was a cute moment when Nicholas had stepped away to do something and Anastasia, one of the waitresses asked me a question. I answered in Russian and she looked accusingly at Nicholas’s seat - You’re Americans! - and gave me a "What gives???" look. I returned the full body shrug - "Yeah, I don’t know either".

When we were done, the barman got out shot glasses and poured shots of Hrenovucha (Хреновуха), which is a traditional drink made from horseradish and vodka. My first toast.

After paying, we headed out towards the main street - Hreshatik. Nicholas was going to watch some football at a nearby bar, and I decided to tag along and then split up and explore. The buildings in this part of town are very European; the feel is upscale. Passed through Shevchenko (apparently a Ukrainian hero) park. The trees are stunning here. We don’t have many hardwoods in Alaska, but they’ve got them in abundance. As we entered the park, we passed numerous tables with people playing chess and other games. Lovely atmosphere - that sort of background murmur of people conversing and enjoying a beautiful park. In a city of 2.8 million, with all of the bustle and hustle that entails, you need parks like this.

*I’ve missed cobblestone paths and streets!*

When we got to Hreshatik, we parted ways; I headed  down the main street while Nicholas went for his football. Thursday was Constitution day and they’d closed down Hreshatik to cars. It’s striking to see a large portion of the city out together, having a good time.

*...2014, during the protests.*

If you know about the protests that rocked Kyiv in 2013 and 2014, this is where they happened; things started out peacefully, but didn’t stay that way. Imagine pro-Russian president and the police against citizens. Unfortunately, they deployed snipers against the protesters and armed the police with live ammo. If you’re interested in learning more, I recommend the 2014 film "[Maidan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3675486/)" to experience the protests. It doesn’t explain much, though; "[Winter of Fire: Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4908644/?ref_=nv_sr_1)" looks to do that.

*Heading down to the metro. Some of the stations are _deep_, two whole long escalator rides*

*A metro station. Some are attractions in their own right, with art and sculptures dating back to Soviet times. The trains are excruciatingly loud.*

After walking around, soaking in the energy of the crowd and taking photos, I headed to the nearest metro station and rode it one stop north; that put me a few minutes walk from the bar where the language exchange Meetup was happening. This is the part of the story where I draw attention to myself and pay for it.

I walked across the street; not at a crosswalk. It caught someone’s attention and he started following me. He introduced himself as being with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). Think FBI. I don’t know if he was actually with them; he showed his credentials briefly. He was telling me that he could fine me for crossing the street, but I’m pretty sure it was just because he wanted some money. 

We talked for around 40 minutes. Talked about God, how he’s the one who I can be sure will keep me safe. He said he didn’t believe in God after fighting - killing people, being at war. It was the oddest encounter, because on one level we were conversing and on another he was trying to convince me that I needed to give him money.

After that I was stressed and thirsty, and set off to look for Habana, where the language exchange Meetup was. The block it was on was a single building - a square - with an open courtyard in the middle and arches/tunnels leading into it. Lots of bars, some sort of fight club - but no Habana! I even asked people. Eventually a girl told me I had walked right by it. I went where she said and still missed it. Because you could only see the sign if you stepped off the sidewalk onto the street! This surely goes on the list of "Things I didn’t expect to be difficult, but which turned out to be".

*One of the French guys, at Habana*

The Meetup was fun, low key; mostly Ukrainians, with two French guys, and later, another American. We played "Head’s Up". I felt terrible, because I wrote ‘A moose’ on one of the slips of paper, and one of the French guys got it; he never did guess what he was. Should have done something easier! He asked if it flies and his compatriot said it does if you believe in it! (Thinking of Rudolph and the reindeer). The language barrier (we all spoke English) made the game harder and much more ridiculous. Jokes about eating hedgehogs and more! Good times.

*Uber ride home. The driver has seen a lot! He served in the military in Vladivostok in Soviet times, and has very strong feelings about Russia and its people.*

Got home later than I’d planned and crashed - it was almost 1 am and I’d got up at 5.

Pretty much sums up Thursday. Probably won’t write quite this much in the future, my course starts Monday!
